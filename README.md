# Biopython-for-beginners
This respiratory contains biopython codes that cane help to edit, filter, search, count and do many other cool stuff with DNA sequences obtained from various biological material :)

#Reading Sequence Files in Biopython
Dealing with assorted sequence file formats is one of the strengths of Biopython. 
The primary module we'll be using is Bio.SeqIO, which is short for sequence input/output (following the naming convention set by BioPerl's SeqIO module).

example scripts:
1. beg_extract_seq.py
2. count_fasta.py
3. count_record.py
